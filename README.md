 🧾 Datasets Used

The following datasets were used and are placed under the `data/` folder:

| File Name             | Description                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `train.csv`           | Historical sales data                      |
| `test.csv`            | Store/product data to forecast             |
| `sales_predictions.csv` | Output predictions from ML model (optional) |

These datasets were preprocessed and loaded into Power BI for visualization.
⚠️ Note: `train.csv` is too large for GitHub. You can [download it here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18ud4Yl7RiI7329CgJjOzdVgC0tuOErXF/view?usp=sharing) via Google Drive.
